            <h3>Assessment of Fees</h3>
            <p>Fees will be assessed based on information provided to Knight & Rose. These fees are subject to change if errors, omissions or changes regarding this information are to arise.
            New instructions may lead to additional work, which may lead to additional fees.
            To minimise costs for myself, I accept that I should communicate a cancellation as soon as possible. 
            I accept that a mileage charge of £0.45 per mile applies if Rosamund Knight of Knight & Rose has to drive to another location than her place of work or supply for my project. This does not apply to any free design consultations as mentioned in this contract. </p>
            
            <h3>Commitments and Deadlines</h3>
            <p>Knight & Rose will endeavour to meet deadlines IF they are mentioned at the initial consultation and I cooperate fully including (but not only) by making myself available for fittings and making committed decisions quickly.
            I understand that Knight & Rose accepts no liability for defaults due to acts of god or events beyond their reasonable control.
            I understand that Knight & Rose will accept urgent work at the discretion of Rosamund Knight. Such work will be done on a best endeavours basis and will attract a premium fee.</p>
            
            <h3>Liability</h3>
            <p>I acknowledge that Knight & Rose accepts liability only for damage relating to my own property being worked on IF such damage was caused by negligence of the staff. Knight & Rose will not be liable for any damage caused otherwise. Strict liability is excluded. 
            Knight & Rose accepts no liability, whether strict liability or liability in negligence, for damage to other property caused by products made or worked upon by Knight & Rose. It is advised that all products are washed professionally, or as per instructions given, so as to prevent the running of dyes. It is also advised not to overload products such as bags not designed to bear high weights. 
            In the event of an item becoming damaged after it has been given to the client as a fulfilled order, Knight & Rose accepts no liability, UNLESS it can be proven that such damage was related to the negligence of staff.. 
            Damages resulting from any breach of this contract are limited to the price of the orders made, which includes the cost of the materials, but NOT delivery charges. </p>
            
            
            <h3>Measurements</h3>
            <p>Orders will be made according to a complete set measurements made at the time of order. This may involve varying methods, including using tape measures and pin-fitting fabric to the customer’s body. 
            You should inform Knight & Rose if measurements are to change due to weight loss, pregnancy or other factors, so that orders can be planned accordingly. 
            Significant changes to an order due to changes in measurements will lead to extra work. This may lead to extra fees being charged. 
            If a client changes their mind about an order, or about other things which would affect the order, such as what shoes or undergarments to wear, or what colours schemes to use, then Knight & Rose will carry out such changes IF they are reasonably practicable. This decision remains at her discretion, and may lead to extra fees being charged.  </p>
            
            <h3>Appointments</h3>
            <p>Knight & Rose is only obliged to see clients if an appointment has been booked with the company.
            Appropriate attire, including underwear and shoes are to be worn to fitting appointments. If the fitting cannot proceed due to inappropriate preparation by the customer, then it may be delayed or postponed, which may result in further costs for the client. 
            Appointments usually last an hour, but may last longer. 
            Please telephone/email/message in advance to cancel appointments. Missed or late appointments may incur extra charges. To minimise these charges, it is advised to notify Knight & Rose as soon as possible. </p>
            
            <h3>Materials</h3>
            <p>Most materials will be purchased by Knight & Rose.
            If materials are supplied by the client, it is the client’s responsibility to ensure that they are fit for use. Knight & Rose reserves the right to refuse to work with unsuitable materials. Staff will provide advice as to the suitability of materials, as well as quantity, if required. Knight & Rose will return any significant excess materials alongside the completed orders upon request. 
            Fitting, delivery & payment:
            Please respond to a request for fitting or delivery within two weeks; Knight & Rose will impose a storage fee of £25 per week after two weeks, UNLESS otherwise agreed. At the FULL discretion of Knight & Rose, this fee may be waived if Knight & Rose is satisfied that there are reasonable grounds for the delay.
            Full payment is required before orders may be collected or delivered. 
            Knight & Rose may withhold any property given to Knight & Rose to work on, or any property she has made or bought for my order, until payments are received IN FULL.
            Cancellation and defaults by the client:
            Upon cancellation by the client, Knight & Rose reserves the right to deduct a reasonable cancellation fee, costs for work done, costs for materials ordered, and any other costs which might reasonably arise as a result of my order. This does not affect Knight & Rose’s rights in relation to any other damages which may arise as a result of Knight & Rose’s relations with me. If reasonable costs exceed the value of the deposit, Knight & Rose reserves the right to claim such costs.
            Knight & Rose reserves the right to withhold any property given to her by the customer until all reasonably arising fees have been paid. If this results in additional, reasonable storage costs for Knight & Rose, these will also be charged to the client. </p>
            
            <h3>Intellectual Property </h3>
            <p>Knight & Rose retains all intellectual property rights regarding her products, designs and any other aspect of her business. You may not use, sell or otherwise appropriate such property without Knight & Rose’s express consent and ONLY as far as Knight & Rose allows. Any infringement of these rights will lead to civil action, which may mean damages are to be paid. 
            Knight & Rose reserves the right to upload images of finished products for Knight & Rose’s business. Images of a final garment will only be shared AFTER the client has worn it in public, as Knight & Rose wouldn’t wish to ruin the surprise of a person debuting their new clothes. Photographs of persons will only be taken with that person’s consent, which may be revoked at any time, leading to said photographs being deleted. </p>
