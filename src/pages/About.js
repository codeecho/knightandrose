            <p>Picture of me doing some sewing?I have always had a passion for textiles, leading my mother to despair when I was a preteen in the 90’s, making hair scrunchies and drawing around my favourite dresses to see if I could remake them! I used to salivate over my mum’s Prima magazines, as they always had dressmaking patterns in them, and was lucky enough to get my hands on a mini sewing machine when I was 12.</p>

            <p>When the textiles department in my secondary school closed down, I was absolutely devastated, and focused my creativity on painting. This led me to study fine art at the University of Chichester, where I was once again drawn to textiles, painstaking folding pieces of organza, satin, cottons and shiny polyester to then depict on canvas with oil paint, as I loved the visual effect of light playing on the fabrics. I learnt a lot about the different qualities of fibres and weaves whilst studying, and put this to use when designing garments now. Some of these paintings are hung around my home, and you will see them when you visit my home studio. Picture of a painting here.</p>

            <p>I returned to sewing when I had my daughter 4 years ago, as I wore her in a sling on my back a lot, and needed something to cover us both as protection from the elements. This is when I started to make a career of my sewing after other babywearing mothers told me they wanted a cape too, and I used my knowledge of the properties of different fabrics learned whilst studying for my degree to make something that was water resistant and temperature regulating. The ‘babywearing cape’ that I created was (and as far I know, still is) completely unique, and I am rather proud that a relatively simple garment was the springboard into fulfilling my childhood dreams of a career in dressmaking.</p>

            <p>I get emotionally invested with everybody I work for, I absolutely love working with you to create something beautiful and unique, and have been known to reach for the tissues, along with the client, when they put on the final garment that fits them perfectly and are so incredibly happy! A picture of me in something I have made?! Perhaps corset...</p>
