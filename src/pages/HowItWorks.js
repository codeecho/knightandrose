            <p>From an initial appointment to the dress of your dreams. Sketch then pic of final dress?</p>

            <p>Before we meet for the first time, I will chat to you by telephone or skype to have an initial conversation about what your ideas are. Following this, I require a £20 fee for our first face to face appointment, where I will have drawn up several designs for you based on our conversation. This is then redeemable against the final garment if you wish to engage my services .Your measurements will also be taken at this time, so please ensure you are wearing underwear similar to what you’ll be wearing when you wear your dress! Tea, coffee, and cake is provided for the bridal party at design appointments, which can last up to two hours, and prosecco is also available for the bride.</p>

            <p>We will work together to design your dream dress, I can give you tips on what styles would suit you most, and you can share your likes/dislikes with me. I often find that customers know what they don’t want, but are fairly clueless on what they do want! Feel free to connect with me on pinterest insert link to my pinterest link here, where we can share a board to chat about design aspects of dresses that you have seen online and like the look of. Please be aware, I will not copy a dress outright, as not only is it unethical to copy someone else’s design work, it stifles my creativity to create something truly unique.</p>

            <p>I have an incredible amount of samples in my studio with a range of prices to suit any price. These consist of silks, taffetas, laces, european laces, embroidered tulles, and beaded embroidery. The possibilities really are endless, and samples are marked with coloured stars to give an idea of price - this can ensure you can stick to a budget if you have one! Pic of bridal samples</p>

            <p>Once my designs are approved by you, I will create a toile out of muslin cloth to check the garment fits, and we can make any changes to the design if you so wish. Then I will order your fabrics to make the garment. Get pic of me doing some kind of fitting here.</p>

            <p>Unlike conventional bridal stores, no adjustments will need to be made to your dress as it will have been created just for you, with your measurements, and as alterations can sometimes cost several hundred pounds, it really is more cost effective to go bespoke.</p>

            <p>I genuinely love making bespoke dresses, and have been known to get a little emotional when customers have put on the final garment and see the difference a perfectly fitting gown can make!</p>
